# Neural Dependency Parsing

This repository contains code for a project on Neural Dependency Parsing. The project involves parsing raw data, preprocessing it, and implementing two different models for dependency parsing: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Feed-forward Neural Network.

## Code Structure

- `code/`: This folder contains the implementation code.
    - `data/`: Raw data resides here.
    - `data_preprocessing/`: Contains code for preprocessing the raw data to extract useful information.
    - `SVM/`: Implementation code for the Support Vector Machine model.
    - `Feed-forward neural network/`: Implementation code for the Feed-forward Neural Network model.

## SVM Implementation Notes

In the SVM code, all file paths are relative. Make sure to adjust them according to your file system.

## Feed-forward Neural Network Implementation Notes

In the Feed-forward Neural Network code, the file paths for representing word embeddings are relative. You need to download the pre-trained model from [IndicNLP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g5_dJFI3Sevwi-YMPU67x2jnN-_JzZX6/view) and adjust the paths accordingly.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python
- json
- re
- sklearn
- scipy
- torch
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- fasttext
